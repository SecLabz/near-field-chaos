  <strong>Interact with ST25TB tags and glitch their counters.</strong>
</div>

## Introduction

The project allows reading and writing ST25TB tags and manipulating their counters. 
Using a Raspberry Pi Pico (or other RP2040 boards) paired with NFC shields (PN532, TRF7970A), it employs a "tear-off" glitching method to override tag's firmware restrictions, enabling otherwise limted counter operations.

## Features

- Web UI for reading, writing, loading, and saving ST25TB tags
- Command line interface
- Standalone mode with learning, restoring, and emulating capabilities

## Cheapest minimal setup

## Hardware Requirements

* RP2040 board (Raspberry Pi Pico, RP2040-Zero, etc...)
* NFC Shield: any PN532 with SPI or TRF7070A shield (Elechouse PN532 V3, DLP-7970ABP, etc...)
* ST25TB Tag

## Wiring

For TRF7970A wiring, check [firmware/nfc/devices.h](firmware/nfc/devices.h) 

## Flashing the firmware

* Download the latest firmware from the release page
* Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico, connect it via USB, and release when RPI-RP2 appears
* Drag and drop the UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 drive

## Web UI

Visit this [page](https://seclabz.github.io/near-field-chaos/index.html) in a web browser with Web Serial support (e.g., Chrome).

Connect your Pico via USB, click "Open", select your Pico's serial port, and you're ready to go.

## CLI

Use your favorite serial tool to interact with the CLI.

Here is a browser terminal console: https://console.zacharyschneider.ca/

```sh
screen /dev/tty.usbmodem101
```

## Standalone mode

In standalone mode, no computer is needed to interact with tags.

The reset button cycles through three functions, indicated by LED colors:

- **Learn**: Reads and saves a tag to flash memory (blue LED üîµ).
- **Restore**: Restores a saved tag (yellow LED üü°).
- **Emulator**: Allows a smartphone to interact with tags via the PN532 (purple LED üü£).

> **_NOTE:_** This mode is only available for the RP2040-Zero board / PN532 combination.

## Tear off notes

- It should work with most tags, but if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt, you can adjust a few parameters such as ```tear_off_adjustment_us``` or ```write_passes```.
- The TRF7970A is a faster, though more expensive, NFC chip that offers quicker counter glitching.
- The PN532 performs best when the tag is correctly positioned; the optimal sweet spot is shown in the photo below.

## Build and deploy

- Install the pico's sdk
- Define the target device in [firmware/CMakeLists.txt](firmware/CMakeLists.txt)
- To customize the pins, modify the [firmware/nfc/devices.h](firmware/nfc/devices.h) file accordingly.

```sh
chmod +x ./build_deploy.sh
./build_deploy.sh
```
